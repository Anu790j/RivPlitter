                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The primary goal of the RivPLitter research is to advance the state of the art in river plastic litter detection and quantification. Plastic pollution in rivers represents a critical environmental challenge, as freshwater systems serve as primary conduits for debris transport into seas and oceans. This dataset is made available (upon request) for the academic community.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Release of the dataset</h3>
                    <p>To advance the state of the art in river plastic litter detection, the RivPLitter dataset is made available for the academic community. All requests must be submitted in writing by the head of the research group or supervisor on behalf of the student or individual researcher (henceforth, the “Researcher”). Requests must be directed to Ali Reza Alaei and Partha Prathim Roy and their decision regarding authorization to access the dataset is final. To receive a copy of the imagery, the authorized Researcher must sign this document and agree to observe the restrictions listed below. In addition to other possible remedies, failure to observe these restrictions may result in the revocation of permission to use the data and denial of access to the dataset. There will be no charge for the data made available.</p>

                    <h3>Consent: Researcher agrees to the following restrictions:</h3>
                    <ol>
